<span>M</span>MT helped spruce up the look and feel of Cornell University’s Lynah Rink, home to Cornell’s men’s and women’s elite hockey programs. The University asked MMT to help bring Lynah Rink to life.
The branding project included concourse door murals highlighting their student athletes, dehumidifier wraps to dress up some eye-sore areas, directional signage, restroom graphics, team room door murals and press box wall murals. From site survey to fabrication to the final install, MMT successfully completed the hat trick!
