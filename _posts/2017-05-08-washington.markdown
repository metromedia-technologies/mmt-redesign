<span>M</span>MT was proud to be a part of the team that completed the new Cougar Football Complex at Washington State University. Working with a regional design team, MMT printed and installed wallpaper for the new Recruit Room and the Players’ Lounge. The Recruit Room has the feel of an upscale boardroom and overlooks the Cougar practice fields. The Players’ Lounge, a unique, private space for the football team, also includes four quotes created out of dimensional letters on the walls opposite the wallpaper. It all adds up to a winning look for the Cougars.
