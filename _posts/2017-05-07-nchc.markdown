<span>M</span>MT helped transform the Target Center in Minneapolis for the annual Frozen FaceOff conference tournament held by the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC).

One of the key objectives of the project is to transform The Target Center, which is home to the NBA Minnesota Timberwolves, from a basketball-centric venue to a hockey-centric, NCHC-branded venue. MMT Sports provides turnkey services to the NCHC, including design, production, and installation of the visual graphics that adorn the locker rooms, concourse, and in-arena areas of the venue.

In addition to the tournament graphics, MMT is also responsible for providing the design, production and installation of the NCHC branded elements for the conferenceâ€™s annual awards banquet which is held the night prior to the tournament in downtown Minneapolis. In a matter of hours, the Muse Events Center is magically transformed into an NCHC-branded venue that inspires, motivates, and engages each of the student-athletes, coaches, and staff.
