<span>M</span>MT helped transform the Target Center in Minneapolis for the annual Frozen FaceOff conference tournament held by the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC).

One of the key objectives of the project was to transform The Target Center, which is home to the NBA Minnesota Timberwolves, from a basketball-centric venue to a hockey-centric, NCHC-branded venue. MMT Sports provided turnkey services to the NCHC, including design, production, and installation of the visual graphics that adorned the locker rooms, concourse, and in-arena areas of the venue.

In addition to the tournament graphics, MMT was also responsible for providing the design, production and installation of the NCHC branded elements for the conferenceâ€™s annual awards banquet which was held the night prior to the tournament in downtown Minneapolis. In a matter of hours, the Muse Events Center was magically transformed into an NCHC-branded venue that inspired, motivated, and engaged each of the student-athletes, coaches, and staff.
