<span>F</span>or Super Bowl XLVIII, Bud Light went from land to sea.  With the host city being in New Jersey, Bud Light took over a cruise ship, instead of a hotel, to float on the ice of the Hudson River.  For the rebranding process, Bud Light turned to none other than Metromedia Technologies.  The ship was covered from top to bottom with signs and wraps that displayed Bud Light’s infamous logo and their white and blue color scheme popped thanks to MMT’s innovative and vibrant printing process.
