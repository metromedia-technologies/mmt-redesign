<span>W</span>hen Target was looking to scare up some chills for Halloween, they turned to MMT, experts in Electroluminescent Billboards. MMT combined its patented day/night backlit vinyl printing with electroluminescent technology to create spectacular billboards for Target. Using EL Technology, MMT was able to create a SpooKy effect for Target’s billboards.

During the day, the creative depicts a princess and pirate trick-or-treating. But, as the night falls, ominous jack-o-lanterns come alive and a witch’s shadow appears thanks to the patented low-voltage electroluminescent Light Tape® lamps lighting the vinyl from behind.
