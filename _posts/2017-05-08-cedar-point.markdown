<span>D</span>inosaurs were once the largest animals on earth and dominated it for
millions of years. So, when the Cedar Fair Company wanted to re-create the
magnitude and scale of these ferocious reptiles and attract visitors to their
“Dinosaurs Alive” attraction, they turned to MMT.

MMT installed three dinosaurs in all: a Tyrannosaurus Rex in Cleveland, Ohio
and two Stegosauruses, one each in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cincinnati,
Ohio. The T-Rex weighs approximately 2,200 pounds and was created using a steel
frame for support and mounting, hand sculpted foam and a urethane hard
coat.
