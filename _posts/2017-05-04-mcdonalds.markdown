<span>W</span>hen McDonald's released their new menu item, apple cinnamon walnut oatmeal, they turned to MMT to print their out of home campaign. Transit shelters pose a unique problem by being both back-lit and not back-lit. Some transit shelters are back-lit 24/7 and others are only lit at night. MMT offers double sided printing as well as single sided printing on transit shelters to accommodate for all situations.
