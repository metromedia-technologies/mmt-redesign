<span>I</span>n preparation for the Super Bowl XLV, MMT produced and installed 66,000 sq ft of visual displays on The Omni Hotel & Renaissance Tower in Dallas TX in 6 DAYS. These visual displays were imaged on perforated, self-adhesive vinyl window film applied to the outside glass of these buildings. This unique material is perforated with tiny holes allowing people inside the building to see through the covered windows. The conception of large format outdoor advertising in the form of building wraps has allowed the marketer to create iconic landmarks while communicating larger than life messages with unparalleled opportunities.
