<span>W</span>hen McDonald's released their new menu item, apple cinnamon walnut oatmeal, they turned to MMT to print their out of home campaign. MMT did the production on both the bulletin work as well as the transit work. The challenge with printing on multiple subrates accross multiple devices is that those variables can change color. At MMT we profile every machine adhering to G7 standards to ensure as close a match as possible across all of our substrates and devices.
