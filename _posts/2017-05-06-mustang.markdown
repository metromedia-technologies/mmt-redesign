<span>F</span>or the launch of the 2010 Mustang, Ford Motor Company needed something ‘spectacular’ to catch everyone’s eye. With an idea in mind, they came to MMT knowing we could get the job done. Three weeks of careful planning, coordination and collaboration resulted in what you see here. Using a combination of MMT’s industry leading painted bulletin, a heavy-duty fog machine, a motor and a working brake to stop the tire, the effect created was visible from hundreds of feet away for motorists traveling down the highway.
