<span>W</span>hen the Hard Rock Cafe in Bayside Marketplace, Miami, near
Biscayne Bay, needed to brand their building for better brand
recognition, they turned to MMT to produce and install inwindow
displays.

The unusual shape of the building and taxing angles made this
project particularly challenging. MMT used self-adhesive, nonpreforated,
3M material that shaped to the Hard Rock Cafe’s
glass façade.
