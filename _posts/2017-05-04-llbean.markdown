<span>T</span>he idea was to create a striking visual display that embodied the essence of L.L. Bean while attracting mall-goers into its new store in the Paramus Park Mall in New Jersey. The result was MMT and GSD&M joining forces. Together, they made a “realistic” stream using floor graphics that led customers to the L.L. Bean store. The project included elevator displays, escalator wraps and out-of-home ads that invited people to “step into the outdoors.” The campaign earned GSD&M a 2012 OBIE Award for Best in Show.
