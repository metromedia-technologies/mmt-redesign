<span>T</span>o celebrate the Stanley Cup finals birth of the Chicago Blackhawk's, McDonald's created hockey stick shaped french fries. With the help of MMT these 3D props were able to come to life for the eventual Stanley Cup Champions. Viewing larger-than-life advertisements of french fries and cheeseburgers can make a person’s mouth water! Having McDonald’s promotions created by MMT makes for a mouth-watering display.
