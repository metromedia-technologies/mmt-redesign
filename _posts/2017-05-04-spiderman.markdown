<span>S</span>pider-Man’s greatest battle begins on these EL-backed bulletins in both New York City and Los Angeles! Through a design collaboration with the creative agency and MMT’s own pre-production artists, this electrifying design comes to life at night when Electro enters the scene! Using electro-luminescent panels and MMT’s proprietary double-sided printing, Spider-man’s epic battle shines brightly in both day and night!

With great quality printing comes great responsibility. How can MMT help you?
