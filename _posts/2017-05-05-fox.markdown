<span>D</span>riving down Sunset Blvd. there are many sights to see. One thing that may stand out are these giant back-lit bulletins. MMT prints these using a proprietary paint process in a double sided format. This paint process offers a large gamut and the ability to maintain color consistency whether the product is back-lit or front-lit. For a product that lasts MMT has you covered.
