<span>P</span>alazzo is one of the top Las Vegas luxury hotels, setting new standards with Five-Diamond luxury premier suites in Las Vegas. When Palazzoâ€™s
South wing was to be converted into a high-priced luxury residential complex, the developer wanted people passing by to see what the finished
building would look like. So they chose MMT to produce 87,000 square feet of large-format graphics of the completed building for display in
front of the construction site.
