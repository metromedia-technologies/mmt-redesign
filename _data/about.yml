  body: MMT's printing process ushered in the use of flexible face vinyl which, when printed, allowed the outdoor companies to quickly respond to advertiser needs for timely campaigns.

  body: With the advent of digital printing led by the initial deployment of inexpensive, large format HP printing systems MMT was poised to shift yet again.

- heading: Management
  body: MMT launched an offering solution dubbed “OnePrint”. OnePrint uses a combination of MMT’s proprietary digital imaging devices along with other production processes to satisfy each client’s specific job requirements, regardless of size and scope. In addition to printing capability the Company added the ability to lead a creative process effort and supervise the creation and crafting of hard (as opposed to printed) signage and its installation. This led to the recognition of MMT as a One Stop project management solution, that “One Print” provides for its clients.
